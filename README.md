This project was completed as part of the coursework for CMPUT 291 – Introduction to File and Database Management at the University of Alberta. It leverages SQL within Python to manage an enterprise database, providing users with services like tweet searches, follower lists, and user account management. Using a SQLite database with Python, the program offers a command-line interface for user interactions.  

The Design Document will go through the following:  
 I) General Overview (& User Guide)
