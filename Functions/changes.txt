Changes to make
- Make sure that email is valid format

- 3. For searching keywords, if I search "he," will the tweet with the text "hello" be returned?

--> No. That's only for user search.

- make hashtag search case-insensitive
- hashtag case returning search with no hashtag in it

5. If the tweet text is "#cool" and the user searches "cool", should the tweet be shown?
-->  If the search query is #abcd it should return all tweets containing “#abcd”. I recommend utilizing the hastag_mentions table for this.
--> If the search query is “abcd” it should return all tweets containing “abcd”. it should also return tweets containing "#abcd"

- Search keywords need to be seperated by comma
